# Part IA Exercises 
This repository holds my work for the Computing section of the 
[Engineering Tripos](http://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/courses/engineering) 
Part IA at the [University of Cambridge](http://www.cam.ac.uk).

The code was originally hosted on [Microsoft Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/)
and was moved to GitHub on 14 Oct 2016.
