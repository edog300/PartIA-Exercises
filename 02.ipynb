We then:\n> \n> - Evaluate $f$ at the midpoint $x_{\\rm mid} = (x_0 + x_1)/2$, i.e. compute\n>    $f_{\\rm mid} = f(x_{\\rm mid})$\n> - Evaluate $f(x_0) \\cdot f(x_{\\rm mid})$\n> \n>   - If $f(x_0) \\cdot f(x_{\\rm mid}) < 0$: \n> \n>     $f$ must change sign somewhere between $x_0$ and $x_{\\rm mid}$, hence the root must lie between \n>     $x_0$ and $x_{\\rm mid}$, so set $x_1 = x_{\\rm mid}$.\n>    \n>   - Else\n> \n>     $f$ must change sign somewhere between $x_{\\rm mid}$ and $x_1$, so set\n>     $x_0 = x_{\\rm mid}$.\n> \n> The above steps can be repeated a specified number of times, or until $|f_{\\rm mid}|$\n> is below a tolerance, with $x_{\\rm mid}$ being the approximate root.\n> \n> \n> **Task:** The function\n> \n> $$\nf(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 4x + 12\n$$\n> \n> has one root somewhere between $x_0 = 3$ and $x_1 = 6$.\n> \n> 1. Use the bisection method to find the approximate root using 15 iterations (use a `for` loop).\n> 2.
